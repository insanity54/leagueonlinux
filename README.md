Run League of Legends on Linux without depending on playonlinux

PlayOnLinux frustrates me. The League of Legends PlayOnLinux install script is owned by an inactive maintainer, so nobody can easily install League of Legends through the program that is supposed to make installing games easy. Instead, players must browse the horribly formatted, information overload that is the [PlayOnLinux League of Legends app page](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-1135-League_Of_Legends.html). Working fixes to the install script are published by community members, but because the script maintainer is inactive, the script available through the PlayOnLinux program remains outdated and broken. Last update was 8 months ago, Ugh.


leagueonlinux is an attempt at making a turnkey solution to installing League of Legends on Linux.
